# Day 1 â€“ Band Name Generator ðŸŽ¸

## Description

This beginner Python project generates a band name based on two user inputs:

1. The city the user grew up in.
2. The name of a pet.

The program combines these two words to create a potential band name. Itâ€™s a simple project designed to practice `input()` and string concatenation.

## How it works

The program:

- Greets the user.
- Asks for the city they grew up in.
- Asks for the name of their pet.
- Combines both to form a creative band name.
- Displays the result.

Example output:

Welcome to the Band Name Generator.<br>
What's the name of the city you grew up in? Berlin<br>
What's your pet's name? Miezi<br>
Your band name could be: BerlinMiezi
